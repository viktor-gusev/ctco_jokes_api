## Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
TODO
```

## Test

```bash

```

## Notes

- POST over GET because it is easier to manage request options in body
- node-fetch over axios (or got) because it has been already in use by nestjs

Spent 2h on initial commit (issues with development environment on local machine)


TODO:
- Add Dockerfile
- Setup production ready solution
- Test edge cases (performance)
- Add censorship
